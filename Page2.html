With this methodology, our group would be able to efficiently complete one task at a time and move onto the next task as there is little to no testing involved between different tasks. However, consultation with our client will be required during some stages and therefore there would be a slight agile methodology as our group would revisit tasks to confirm they have been executed to expectations.  </p>
